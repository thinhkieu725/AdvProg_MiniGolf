## Game Description

In Mini Golf, players use strokes to pass the balls into the hole. Because there is a constant coefficient of friction between the balls and the court, the balls will roll slower over time and eventually stop after the stroke. The game course consists of 5 levels, each with two parallel maps and different obstacles on the field. The game's object is to complete the course with the fewest strokes.

* Practice makes perfect. Keep playing to improve your score.
